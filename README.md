Created Card War, Guessing Game, Black Jack, Tic-Tac-Toe, using Python 3.

Card war - 2 players will each start oï¬€ with half the deck, then they each remove a card, compare which card has the highest value, and the player with the higher card wins both cards. This continues till one player loses all of his/her cards and the other player left with the cards is declared the winner.

Black Jack - Get as close to 21 (score) as you can without going over. Dealer hits until she reaches 17. Aces count as 1 or 11. At last, if dealer's hand value is greater than 21 then the dealer loses.
Else if the player's hand value is less than the dealer's hand value then the dealer wins.
Else if the player's hand value is greater than dealer's hand value then the player wins.

Guessing Game - The system generates a random number and the player has to guess the number correctly in as less attempts as they can. Everytime the player makes a guess and results in being closer to the random number picked by the system, the program tells the player that it's getting warmer else it tells the player that it's getting colder every time the player's guess is farther away from the picked number.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game - It's the traditional tic-tac-toe game. Two players o and x respectively and then mark it on the game board. Whoever gets the straight line connected with their marks first, wins.
